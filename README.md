# Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts car prices using advanced deep learning techniques. It showcases practical applications of machine learning in the automotive domain, leveraging modern AI concepts such as neural networks and data preprocessing.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes neural networks for accurate price prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding for robust model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
- **Visualization:** Presents key insights and model predictions through plots and charts.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
- scikit-learn (Data Processing & ML Utilities)
- pandas & numpy (Data Manipulation)
- matplotlib & seaborn (Visualization)

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Import and inspect car dataset (features such as year, mileage, brand, etc.).
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean, encode, and scale the data.
3. **Model Building:** Construct and train a deep neural network for regression.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using standard metrics.
5. **Prediction:** Predict prices for new or unseen car data.
